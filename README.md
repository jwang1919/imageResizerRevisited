# Image Resizer Revisited
Today you will be redoing the JavaScript portion of the Image Resizer project.
The manner in which you will be doing this is similar to the [jsExercises assignment](https://github.com/jwang1919/jsExercises-April5-2016).

## We Do
First, we need to check out the project.

* On this page, click **Fork** in the top right to get your own copy
* Then open up Cloud9, and clone this repository (itâ€™s called **imageResizerRevisited**)
  into your workspace. Leave this workspace as **Custom**.
* Open `image-resizer.js` in your project workspace.

## You Do
Complete all functions in `image-resizer.js`.

Check you work by previewing `checkImageResizer.html`.

If all of the tests are green, then you're done! Preview `index.html` to see the Image Resizer in action!

## Submission
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Image Resizer Revisited"
git push origin master
git push origin master:gh-pages
```
